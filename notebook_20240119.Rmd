This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
random <- sample(1:500, 50, replace=TRUE)
m <- matrix(random, nrow=5, ncol=10, byrow=FALSE)
colnames(m)<-c("cond1", "cond2", "cond3", "cond4", "cond5", "ctrl1", "ctrl2", "ctrl3", "ctrl4", "ctrl5")
rownames(m) <- c("gene1","gene2", "gene3", "gene4", "gene5")
fold_change <- matrix(nrow=5,ncol=5)

for (i in 1:dim(m)[1]){
    for (j in 1:dim(m)[1]){
         fold_change[i,j] <- m[i,j]/m[i,j+5]    
     }
 }
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
