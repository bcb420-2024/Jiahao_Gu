## Assignment 1
HTML notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/bcb420-2024/Jiahao_Gu/blob/main/A1/A1_JiahaoGu.html). 

When compiling the R notebook, the working directory should be set to the folder A1. This folder contains the files referenced in the R notebook, including a critical .csv file containing additional mappings. 

Some of the code used to plot figures is commented out on the R notebook. Uncommenting these prior to compiling will generate the same plots used in the figures (which are intended as a cleaner way of consolidating and presenting all the plots). 

## Assignment 2
HTML notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/bcb420-2024/Jiahao_Gu/blob/main/A2/A2_JiahaoGu.html). The R markdown notebook can be found in the folder A2

When compiling the R notebook, the working directory should be set to the folder A2. The notebook requires this to read an .rds file containing the normalized data from Assignment 1.
